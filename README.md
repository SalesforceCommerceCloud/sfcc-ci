# What is this repository for? #

The focus of the tool is to streamline and easy the communication with Commerce Cloud instances as part of the CI/CD processes. It focuses on the deployment part supporting quality checks such as test execution, not on the quality checks itself.

**Features:**

* Uses Open Commerce APIs completely
* Authentication using Oauth2 only, no Business Manager user needed
* Supported commands include: save state, code deploy, code activate, site import upload, site import, reset state
* WebDAV connectivity
* Configuration of multiple instances
* Aliasing of instances
* Automatic renewal of Oauth2 token
* Command line client and JavaScript API

# How do I get set up? #

## Prerequisites ##

Ensure you have a valid Open Commerce API client ID (API key) set up. If you don't have a Open Commerce API client ID yet, you can create one using the [Account Manager](https://account.demandware.com).

For automation usage you'll need the client ID as well as the client secret for authentication. If you plan to use the interactive mode, you have to configure your API client to use redirect url `http://localhost:8080`.

## Configuration ##

In order to perform certain commands the tool provides, you need to give permission to do that on your Commerce Cloud instance(s). You can do that by modifying the Open Commerce API Settings as well as the WebDAV Client Permissions.

1. Log into the Business Manager
2. Navigate to Administration > Site Development > Open Commerce API Settings
3. Make sure, that you select _Data API_ and _Global_ from the select boxes
4. Add the permission set for your client ID to the settings. 

Use the following snippet as your client's permission set, replace `my_client_id` with your client ID:
```JSON
    {
      "client_id":"my_client_id",
      "resources":
      [
        {
          "resource_id":"/code_versions",
          "methods":["get"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id":"/code_versions/*",
          "methods":["patch"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id":"/jobs/*/executions",
          "methods":["post"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        },
        {
          "resource_id":"/jobs/*/executions/*",
          "methods":["get"],
          "read_attributes":"(**)",
          "write_attributes":"(**)"
        }
      ]
    }
```
Note, if you already have OCAPI Settings configured, e.g. for other clients, add this snippet to the list permission sets for the other clients as follows:
```JSON
    {
      "_v":"18.1",
      "clients":
      [ 
        {
          /* ... */
        },
        /* the new permission set goes here */
      ]
    }
```
5. Navigate to Administration >  Organization >  WebDAV Client Permissions
6. Add the permission set for your client ID to the permission settings.

Use the following snippet as your client's permission set, replace `my_client_id` with your client ID:
```JSON
    {
      "client_id":"my_client_id",
      "permissions":
      [
        {
          "path": "/impex",
          "operations": [
            "read_write"
          ]
        },
        {
          "path": "/cartridges",
          "operations": [
            "read_write"
          ]
        }
      ]
    }
```
Note, if you already have WebDAV Client Permissions configured, e.g. for other clients, add this snippet to the list permission sets for the other clients as follows:
```JSON
    {
      "clients":
      [ 
        {
          /* ... */
        },
        /* the new permission set goes here */
      ]
    }
```
Note: WebDAV client permission to `cartridges` is available in Commerce Cloud Digital versions greater than **17.8**.

## Dependencies ##

If you plan to integrate with the JavaScript API or if you want to download the sources and use the CLI through Node you need Node.js and npm to be installed. No other dependencies.

If do not want to use the JavaScript API, but just the CLI you don't need Node.js and npm necessarily. See "Installation Instructions" for details.

Use `sfcc-ci <sub:command> --help` to get detailed help and example usage of a sub:command.

## Configuration ##

The CLI keeps it's own settings. The location of these settings are OS specific. On Linux they are located at `$HOME/.config/sfcc-ci-nodejs/`, on MacOS they are located at `$HOME/Library/Preferences/sfcc-ci-nodejs/`.

## Environment Variables ##

`sfcc-ci` respects the following environment variables which you can use to control, how the CLI works:

* `SFCC_LOGIN_URL` The login url used for authentication.
* `SFCC_OAUTH_LOCAL_PORT` Oauth local port for authentication flow.
* `DEBUG` Debugging mode.

If you only want a single CLI command to write debug messages prepend the command using, e.g. `DEBUG=* sfcc-ci <sub:command>`.

## Authentication ##

`sfcc-ci` uses a default authorization server. You can overwrite this authorization server and use an alternative login url using the env var `SFCC_LOGIN_URL`:

```bash
export SFCC_LOGIN_URL=<alternative-authorization-server>
```

Removing the env var (`unset SFCC_LOGIN_URL`) will make the CLI use the default authorization server again.

## Oauth Local Port ##

`sfcc-ci` uses a default Oauth local port for authentication flow via command `sfcc-ci auth:login`. You can overwrite this port and use an alternative port number (e.g. if the default port is used on your machine and you cannot use is) using the env var `SFCC_OAUTH_LOCAL_PORT`:

```bash
export SFCC_OAUTH_LOCAL_PORT=<alternative-port>
```

Removing the env var (`unset SFCC_OAUTH_LOCAL_PORT`) will make the CLI use the default port again.

## Debugging ##

You can force `sfcc-ci` to write debug messages to the console using the env var `DEBUG`. You can do this for globally by setting the env var, so that any following CLI command will write debug messages:

```bash
export DEBUG=*
```

If you only want a single CLI command to write debug messages use the the `-D,--debug` flag with any command, e.g. `sfcc-ci <sub:command> --debug`.

## Sorting list ##

To output objects to a sorted list, add the `-S,--sortby` option to one of the supported commands. Sort objects by specifying any field.

## CLI Examples ##

The examples below assume you have defined a set of environment variables:

* a Client ID (API Key)
* a Client Secret (API Secret)
* a User Name (a user in Account Manager)
* a User Password

You can do this as follows:

```bash
export API_KEY=<my-api-key>
export API_SECRET=<my-api-secret>
export API_USER=<my-user>
export API_USER_PW=<my-user-pw>
```

Note: Some CLI commands provide structured output of the operation result as JSON. To process this JSON a tool called `jq` comes in handy. Installation and documentation of `jq` is located at https://stedolan.github.io/jq/manual/. 

### Authentication ###

In an interactive mode you usually authenticate as follows:

```bash
sfcc-ci auth:login $API_KEY
```

Note, that you have to configure your API client to use redirect url `http://localhost:8080`.

In an automation scenario (where no user is physically present) authentication is done as follows:

```bash
sfcc-ci client:auth $API_KEY $API_SECRET $API_USER $API_USER_PW
```

Logging out (and removing any traces of secrets from the machine):

```bash
sfcc-ci auth:logout
```

### Pushing Code ###

Pushing code to any SFCC instance and activate it:

```bash
sfcc-ci code:deploy <path/to/code_version.zip> -i your-instance.demandware.net
sfcc-ci code:activate <code_version> -i your-instance.demandware.net
```

### Data Import ###

Running an instance import (aka site import) on any SFCC instance:

```bash
sfcc-ci instance:upload <path/to/data.zip> -i your-instance.demandware.net
sfcc-ci instance:import <data.zip> -i your-instance.demandware.net -s
```

Running the instance import without waiting for the import to finish you omit the `--sync,-s` flag:

```bash
sfcc-ci instance:import <data.zip> -i your-instance.demandware.net
```

# Using the JavaScript API #

There is a JavaScript API available, which you can use to program against and integrate the commands into your own project.

Make sfcc-ci available to your project by specifying the dependeny in your `package.json` first and running and `npm install` in your package. After that you require the API into your implementation using:

```javascript
  const sfcc = require('sfcc-ci');
```

The API is structured into sub modules. You may require sub modules directly, e.g.

```javascript
  const sfcc_auth = require('sfcc-ci').auth;
  const sfcc_code = require('sfcc-ci').code;
  const sfcc_instance = require('sfcc-ci').instance;
  const sfcc_job = require('sfcc-ci').job;
  const sfcc_webdav = require('sfcc-ci').webdav;
```

The following APIs are available (assuming `sfcc` refers to `require('sfcc-ci')`):

```javascript
  sfcc.auth.auth(client_id, client_secret, callback);
  sfcc.code.activate(instance, code_version, token, callback);
  sfcc.code.deploy(instance, archive, token, options, callback);
  sfcc.code.list(instance, token, callback);
  sfcc.instance.upload(instance, file, token, options, callback);
  sfcc.instance.import(instance, file_name, token, callback);
  sfcc.job.run(instance, job_id, job_params, token, callback);
  sfcc.job.status(instance, job_id, job_execution_id, token, callback);
  sfcc.webdav.upload(instance, path, file, token, options, callback);
```

### Authentication ###

APIs available in `require('sfcc-ci').auth`:

`auth(client_id, client_secret, callback)`

Authenticates a clients and attempts to obtain a new Oauth2 token. Note, that tokens should be reused for subsequent operations. In case of a invalid token you may call this method again to obtain a new token.

callback      | (Function)  | Callback function executed as a result. The token and the error will be passed as parameters to the callback function.

**Returns:** (void) Function has no return value

Example:

```javascript
const sfcc = require('sfcc-ci');

var client_id = 'my_client_id';
var client_secret = 'my_client_id';

sfcc.auth.auth(client_id, client_secret, function(token, err) {
    if(token) {
        console.log('Authentication succeeded. Token is %s', token);
    }
    if(err) {
        console.error('Authentication error: %s', err);
